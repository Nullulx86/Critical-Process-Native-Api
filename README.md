# Critical Process by Native Api

In my initial GitHub repository, I have attempted to create a training project which utilizes two native Windows functions, namely RtlSetProcessIsCritical and NtSetInformationProcess. The purpose of this project is to set the current process as a critical process and vice versa, by employing the aforementioned functions to alter the state of the running process.
